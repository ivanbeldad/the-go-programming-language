// (*IntSet).UnionWith computes the union of two sets using |, the word-parallel bitwise
// OR operator. Implement methods for IntersectWith, DifferenceWith, and SymmetricDifference
// for the corresponding set operations. (The symmetric difference of two
// sets contains the elements present in one set or the other but not both.)
