// The type of each word used by IntSet is uint64, but 64-bit arithmetic maybe
// inefficient on a 32-bit platform. Modify the program to use the uint type, which is the most
// efficient unsigned integer type for the platform. Instead of dividing by 64, define a constant
// holding the effective size of uint in bits, 32 or 64. You can use the perhaps too-clever
// expression 32 << (^uint(0) >> 63) for this purpose.
