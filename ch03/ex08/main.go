// Rendering fractals at high zoom levels demands great arithmetic precision.
// Implement the same fractal using four different representations of numbers: complex64,
//  complex128, big.Float, and big.Rat. (The latter two types are found in the math/big package.
// Float uses arbitrary but bounded-precision floating-point; Rat uses unbounde d-precision
// rational numbers.) How do they compare in perfor mance and memory usage? At what zoom
// levels do rendering artifacts become visible?
